I do a little bit of freelance work and need to create invoices. There are invoicing solutions out there, and [Billdu](https://www.billdu.com/) comes closest to what I want. But I can't justify a monhtly subscription. I've used PayPal invoicing. I'm not wild about its UX, but tracking and receiving payment is easy. One of my two customers doesn't use PayPal, however, so I need a system that can use PayPal but not depend on it. I'd like a single unified interface for entering hours and creating invoices that the customer can view without a login. I'd like to connect or plug in several different payment providers -- PayPal, Stripe, and who knows what else. One customer uses snail mail, so simply having my mailing address on the invoice works.

So, this a Blazor app using a Postgres backend to enter hours and create invoices. I'm using DigitalOcean to host the database, and there's no local database option currently. I am using standard EF migrations to manage the database, so I think in theory you could create the database yourself locally.
